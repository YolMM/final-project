##  1. <a name='Introduction'></a> Introduction

This is my final project for [CORE Code School](https://www.corecode.school/).

Everyone knows the famous photographer [John Doe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe), so here it is his [website](https://i.gifer.com/1kpe.mp4). There you will be able to find some information about him, his work, reviews from other customers, prices and even make an appointment to discuss anything you need with John Doe.

##  2. <a name='Motivation'></a> Motivation

My sister is a photographer. When I started this bootcamp, she used to joke about I would do a website for her work as soon as I could. So I took it seriously, but first I wanted to do a beta version. If this works properly, I could have free photos for the rest of my life, so I'm all in ðŸ˜¼

##  3. <a name='Structure'></a> Structure

This is just a regular photograper website, where the customer can find information about the studio and the photographer, some pictures of photographer's previous works, leave a review, see reviews from others customers, select a pack of photos or create their own pack and make an appointment.
