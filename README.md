##  1. <a name='Introduction'></a> Introduction

This is my final project for [CORE Code School](https://www.corecode.school/).

Everyone knows the famous photographer [John Doe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe), so here it is his [website](). There you will be able to find some information about him, his work, reviews from other customers, prices and even make an appointment to discuss anything you need with John Doe.

##  2. <a name='Motivation'></a> Motivation

My sister is a photographer. When I started this bootcamp, she used to joke about I would do a website for her work as soon as I could. So I took it seriously, but first I wanted to do a beta version. If this works properly, I could have free photos for the rest of my life, so I'm all in ðŸ˜¼

##  3. <a name='Structure'></a> Structure

The project is a monorepo and its structure is:
